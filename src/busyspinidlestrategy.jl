    struct BusySpinIdleStrategy <: IdleStrategy

    Busy spin strategy targeted at lowest possible latency. This strategy will monopolise a thread to achieve the lowest
    possible latency. Useful for creating bubbles in the execution pipeline of tight busy spin loops with no other logic
    than status checks on progress.

    Idle strategy for use by threads when they do not have work to do.

    **Note regarding implementor state:**
    Some implementations are known to be stateful, please note that you cannot safely assume implementations to be
    stateless. Where implementations are stateful it is recommended that implementation state is padded to avoid false
    sharing.

    **Note regarding potential for TTSP (Time To Safe Point) issues:**
    If the caller spins in a 'counted' loop, and the implementation does not include a safepoint poll this may cause a
    TTSP (Time To SafePoint) problem. If the implementation does not include a safepoint poll, then the caller should
    include a call to `GC.safepoint()` in the loop.

"""
    Perform current idle action (e.g. nothing/yield/sleep). This method signature expects users to call into it on
    every work 'cycle'. The implementations may use the indication `workCount > 0` to reset internal backoff
    state. This method works well with 'work' APIs which follow the following rules:

    - 'work' returns a value larger than 0 when some work has been done
    - 'work' returns 0 when no work has been done
    - 'work' may return error codes which are less than 0, but which amount to no work has been done

    Callers are expected to follow this pattern:

    ```julia
    while is_running
        idle(idleStrategy, doWork())
    end
    ```

    # Arguments
    - `workCount::Integer`: The number of work performed in the last duty cycle.
